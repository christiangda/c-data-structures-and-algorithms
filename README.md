# c-data-structures-and-algorithms

Collection of data structures and algorithms in C.

This is a just for fun project to implement data structures and algorithms in C.

The goal is to learn and understand the concepts of data structures and algorithms using C and
the tools ecosystem around C, like make, valgrind, etc.

## Implementations
